# filecrypt2: Secure File Encryption (Under Development)

**filecrypt2** is a file encryption tool written in Go, designed to provide robust security for your sensitive data.

**Features:**

* **Strong Encryption:** Employs advanced encryption algorithms for maximum protection.
* **AI-Enhanced Security:** Leverages AI to explore innovative encryption techniques and stay ahead of emerging threats.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Offers a highly intuitive and easy-to-use experience.

**Development Plans:**

* **AI Assistance:** As this is my first code project, AI is assisting me in its development. Therefore, when completed, this program may have zero bugs and offer exceptionally high security. Additionally, AI will help me identify popular encryption techniques that we can incorporate into this project later.
* **Diverse Encryption Options:** Implement a variety of encryption algorithms to cater to different security needs.
